        <HistoryBox year={2012} name={'1st - SIMIC'}>
          SIMIC (Siriraj International Microbiology and Immunology Competition) firstly held in 2011-2012 after Thailand hosted IFMSA's General Assembly. This event sparked the idea among Siriraj medical students, driven by Dr.Janewit Wongboonsin, Dr. Bantawit Sudsanguan, and a dedicated team, to establish an annual international gathering, focusing on 'PLAN' qualities: Publicity, Leadership, Academic Excellence, and Networking. Thus, SIMIC was conceived as a platform for knowledge exchange, growth, and meaningful experiences.
